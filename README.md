# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# OVERVIEW
We've been asked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program we have created. In order to achieve this we needed to take create a database using PostgreSQL, import employee data into those tables, create new views of those tables, and filter/ join tables where needed to get us the desired data in the format we're looking for.
